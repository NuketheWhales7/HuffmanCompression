Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious stuff. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Hi, Marty. Okay, but I don't know what to say. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.  Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. He's a very strange young man. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Yeah okay.  Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? This sounds pretty heavy. Right, and where am I gonna be? Listen, Doc. Wrecked? When did this happen and- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Back to the future. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.  Your, your right. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.  Yeah. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. What? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.  Yeah, gimme a Tab. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Where does he come from?  He's your brother, Mom. Get your meat hooks off of me. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Your, your right. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?  Yeah, it's 8:00. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Why not? No, Biff, you leave her alone. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?  Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Listen, Doc. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.  Scram, McFly. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, where does he live? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.  He's your brother, Mom. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Yeah, exactly. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.  Hello, Jennifer. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.  Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. What? Oh, what I meant to day was- Right. Where?  Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.  Okay, but I don't know what to say. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Hello. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.  Hello, Jennifer. The flux capacitor. Maybe you were adopted. Ahh. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.  Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Scram, McFly. Next, please. What's that thing he's on? Oh.  I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Next, please. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Hello. Jesus, you smoke too?
